If needed for any calculation type of question or mathematical and use this rules:

1. JSON Formatting
-> Use double quotes for all property names and string values.
-> Add commas after each property and array element.

2. LaTeX and Math Expressions:
-> Use $ delimiters consistently for math expressions (e.g., $x^2$).
-> Use double backslashes for LaTeX commands (e.g., \\alpha, \\frac{x+1}{x-1}).
-> Properly escape special LaTeX structures like fractions (e.g., $\\frac{x+1}{x-1}$).

3. Validation and Formatting:
-> A function normalizes delimiters to $ and ensures proper backslash escaping.
-> JSON structure is validated to ensure compatibility.

4. Dependencies:
-> Use react-markdown, remark-math, and rehype-katex for markdown and LaTeX rendering.

5. Data Structure:
-> Follow the Data interface with testseries (title, duration) and questions (text, answer, options with text).

Example: 

{
  "testseries": {
    "title": "Math Quiz",
    "duration": 600
  },
  "questions": [
    {
      "text": "$\\frac{x+1}{2} = 3$",
      "answer": "$x = 5$",
      "options": [
        { "text": "$x = 3$" },
        { "text": "$x = 5$" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
